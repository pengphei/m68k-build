CCS driver installation overview
--------------------------------

If the user has installed the CodeWarrior tools from a CodeWarrior 
installation CD, then it is assumed that all the drivers for
USB devices are installed properly.

If the user needs to install any ccs device manually, then this document
and the readme.txt files in each driver folder may be followed.

The user needs to be logged on with root privileges for driver
installation.  The drivers are located in the installed CodeWarrior directory,
in the subdirectory ccs/drivers.

Supported Operating Systems*:

  Red Hat Linux 8.0, 9.0, Fedora Core 3, Fedora Core 4
  Mandrake Linux 10.0, SuSE 10.1

  * Limited testing has been performed on the distributions listed above.
    In general, the devices should be usable on any distribution which uses
    a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel, but CCS may need to be run as root if the
    distribution's hotplug scripts differ significantly from the tested
    distributions.
