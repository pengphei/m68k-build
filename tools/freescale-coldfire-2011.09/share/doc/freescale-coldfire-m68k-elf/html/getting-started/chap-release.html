	  GCC now properly passes the 
	  <code class="option">--demangle</code> and <code class="option">--no-demangle</code>
	  options to the linker to control map file output.  The default
	  behavior on all hosts is now to demangle C++ names.
        </p><p><b>Assembler crash. </b>
          The assembler now warns when there is line information for
	  the <code class="literal">*ABS*</code> section, rather than crash.
	  This can occur when the <code class="code">.offset</code> directive is
	  used incorrectly.
        </p><p><b>Support for TWR-MCF5441x board. </b>
          CS3 board support for programs running from SDRAM
          on the TWR-MCF5441x board has been added.
        </p><p><b>GDB interrupt handling bug fix. </b>

	    internal pathnames or tool names within the installation directory
	    have been changed.
	  </span>
	  
        </p><p><b>Interprocedural register optimization. </b>
          The compiler has a new experimental optimization that generates
          better code for functions that only call functions in the same
          object.  To switch this optimization on, use
          <code class="option">-fuse-caller-save</code>.
        </p><p><b>Support for MCF51AG, MCF51JE and MCF51MM ColdFire
	  processors. </b>

	    also been added.
          </span>
        </p><p><b>Improved function call profiling. </b>
          The compiler now supports
          the <code class="option">-finstrument-function-calls</code> option.
          Please see the GCC documentation for more details.
        </p><p><b>Fix GDB crash during connection to debug agent. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash while connecting
	  to any debug agent through standard IO where the debug agent
	  had detected an early error and terminated the communication.
        </p><p><b>Improved disassembler performance in the debugger. </b>
          GDB's disassembler has been improved to use more efficient memory
	  access on remote targets.
        </p><p><b>P&amp;E driver updates. </b>
          The bundled P&amp;E drivers and libraries for both Windows and Linux
	  hosts have been updated.

          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused incorrect code for C++
          constructors for some class hierarchies that use virtual inheritance
          and include empty classes.  At runtime, the incorrect constructors
          resulted in memory corruption or other errors.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id366515"></a>A.1.5. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2011.03-15</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Compiler optimization improvements. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced with a number of optimization
	  improvements, including:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>

        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.5.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ColdFire ELF is now based on GCC version 4.5.2.
        </p><p><b>New <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code> option. </b>
          The compiler has a new
	  option, <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code>, which
	  forces access to a volatile structure member using the width
	  that conforms to its type.
	  
	  
	  Refer to the GCC manual for details. 
        </p><p><b>GCC code generation bug for casts to <code class="code">volatile</code>
          types. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that sometimes caused incorrect code
          for references to pointers to types with <code class="code">volatile</code> casts.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect optimization fix. </b>
          An optimizer bug that in rare cases caused incorrect code to
	  be generated for complex AND and OR expressions containing
	  redundant subexpressions has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect C++ warning fixed. </b>
          A bug in GCC has been fixed that caused spurious warnings
	  about lambda expressions in C++ code that does not use them.
        </p><p><b>GCC bug where accesses to volatile structure fields are optimized away. </b>
          A bug has been fixed where accesses to volatile fields of a structure
	  were sometimes incorrectly optimized away if the structure instance
	  was defined as non-volatile.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id367013"></a>A.1.6. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2010.09-39</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Linker debug information fix. </b>
          A bug in linker processing of debug information has been
          fixed.  The bug sometimes prevented the Sourcery G++ debugger from
          displaying source code if the executable was linked
	  with the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> option.
        </p><p><b>Debugger warnings quieted. </b>
	  GDB no longer prints <code class="literal">RMT ERROR</code> diagnostics
	  on connection to the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite.
	  In spite of the alarming appearance of the messages, they were
	  not actually indicative of a serious problem.
        </p><p><b>Debug Sprite abnormal termination bug fix. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite no longer terminates abnormally
          if GDB is killed while the target is waiting for semihosted
          I/O to complete.  The bug was only triggered when running GDB
          on a Windows host.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id367139"></a>A.1.7. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2010.09-1</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Changes to Sourcery G++ version numbering. </b>
          Sourcery G++ product and Lite toolchains now uniformly use
	  a version numbering scheme of the form 2011.09-21.
	  The major and minor parts of the version number, in this
	  case 2011.09, identify the release branch,
	  while the final component is a build number within the branch.
	  There are also new preprocessor macros defined by the compiler
	  for the version number components so that you may conditionalize
	  code for Sourcery G++ or particular Sourcery G++ versions.
	  Details are available in the 
	  <a class="ulink" href="https://support.codesourcery.com/GNUToolchain/kbentry1" target="_top">
	  Sourcery G++ Knowledge Base</a>.	
        </p><p><b>GCC fix for reference to undefined label. </b>
          A bug in the optimizer that caused GCC to emit references
	  to undefined labels has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Alignment attributes. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to ignore
	  alignment attributes of C++ static member variables where
	  the attribute was present on the definition, but not the
	  declaration.
	</p><p><b>Compiler optimization improvements. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced with a number of optimization
	  improvements, including:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	      More efficient assignment for structures containing bitfields.
	    </li><li>
	      Better code for initializing C++ arrays with explicit
	      element initializers.
	    </li><li>
	      Improved logic for eliminating/combining redundant comparisons in
	      code with nested conditionals.
	    </li><li>
	      Better selection of loop variables, resulting in fewer
	      temporaries and more efficient register usage.
	    </li><li>
              Better code when constant addresses are used as arguments to
              inline assembly statements.
            </li><li>
	      Better code for copying small constant strings.
	    </li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.5.1. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite for ColdFire ELF is now based on GCC version 4.5.1.
	  For more information about changes from GCC version 4.4 that was
	  included in previous releases, see
	  <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.5/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Smaller C++ programs with <code class="option">-g</code>. </b>
          An assembler bug has been fixed that caused unnecessary references
	  to exception-handling routines from C++ programs when debug
	  information is enabled.  For programs that do not otherwise
	  use exceptions, this change results in smaller code size.
        </p><p><b>Additional validation in the assembler. </b>
          The assembler now diagnoses an error, instead of producing
          an invalid object file, when directives such as
          <code class="literal">.hidden</code> are missing operands.
          
        </p><p><b>Strip bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the <code class="command">strip</code> and
	  <code class="command">objcopy</code> utilities, which resulted in
	  stripped object files that the linker could not recognize,
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.20.51.20100809 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Object file flags fix. </b>
          The <code class="command">objdump</code> and
	  <code class="command">readelf</code> utilities have been updated to
	  decode ISA-C and EMAC-B ELF header flags.
        </p><p><b>Additional alignment in CS3-defined linker scripts. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now ensures 8-byte alignment at additional points
	  in CS3-defined linker scripts.  Previously, placing a symbol
	  in certain sections broke the initialization of
	  the <code class="literal">.data</code> and/or <code class="literal">.bss</code>
	  sections.
        </p><p><b>Support for TWR-MCF52259 board. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now includes support for Freescale TWR-MCF52259 boards.
        </p><p><b>Newlib update. </b>
          The Newlib package has been updated to version 1.18.0, with
          additions from the community CVS trunk as of 2010-08-12.
          This update provides additional wide-character functions,
          along with other bug fixes and enhancements.
        </p><p><b><code class="function">malloc</code> fix. </b>
          A bug that sometimes caused <code class="function">free</code> to
          dereference an invalid address has been fixed.  The bug was
          caused by incorrect handling
          within <code class="function">malloc</code> of calls
          to <code class="function">sbrk</code> from outside
          of <code class="function">malloc</code>.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  7.2.50.20100908.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including improved C++ language support,
	   a new command to save breakpoints to a file,
	   a new
	  convenience variable <code class="varname">$_thread</code> that holds
	  the number of the current thread, among many other
	  improvements.
	</p><p><b>GDB crash fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash on launch if
          the environment variable <code class="literal">CYGPATH</code> is set
          to a program that does not exist or cannot be executed.
        </p><p><b>ColdFire V2-V4 OSBDM support. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite has been fixed to work around
	  OSBDM driver issues for ColdFire V2-V4 boards.  The issues fixed
	  include  failure to perform semihosting operations.
